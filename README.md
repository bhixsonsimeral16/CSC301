# CSC301

This repository contains the projects that I worked on in my Algorithms & Data Structures course at Cornell College.  All projects were completed in Java using the Eclipse IDE. All of these algorithms have an accompaning readme that details a complexity and memory analysis.

##8Puzzle

This problems takes a typical sliding puzzle I needed to create an algorithm to solve it or otherwise say that it was unsolveable.

##AutocompleteMe

Used a binary search to autocomplete potential search terms.

##KdTrees

Implemented a KdTree and solved some arbitrary problems about lines rectangles, lines, and, dots.

##RandomizedQueuesandDeques

Wrote my own RandomizedQueue and Deque data structures.

##SeamCarving

Wrote an algorithm to delete only the least important row or column of pixels when resizing an image.

##percolationEclipse

Take a NxN grid with either open or closed spaces.  If water is poured in the top, will it percolate to the bottom.
